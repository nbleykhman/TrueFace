note over Dataset: Low-res GAN + real faces\nDiffusion generated
loop 2 epochs
Dataset->Warm Up: Large training subsample
note over Warm Up: Low-temperature randomization
Warm Up->Regularization:
note over Regularization: High batch ct; high weight decay
Regularization->Evaluation:
Dataset->Evaluation: Validation subsample
note over Evaluation: Validate weights
end
loop 5 epochs
Dataset->Fine Tuning: Small training subsample
note over Fine Tuning: Balance sample distribution
Fine Tuning->Regularization:
note over Regularization: Low batch ct; low weight decay
Regularization->Evaluation:
note over Evaluation: Test on individual & combined splits
Evaluation->Metrics: compute ROC AUC, acc, precision, recall, F1
note over Metrics: generate confusion matrices for each split
